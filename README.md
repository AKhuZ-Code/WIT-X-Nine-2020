# WIT-X-Nine-2020

Project: 2020 WIT X Nine Data Analytics Competition - Exploratory Data Analysis (in Python)

Date: 31/10/2020

## Built with...

• Python (pandas, numpy, pyplot (matplotlib))

## File Dictionary

• <b>EDA Code - unprocessed data.py</b>: Python code used to compile the four given large datasets and perform exploratory data analysis

• <b>EDA Code - processed data.py</b>: Python code used to perform exploratory data analysis on a processed dataset that stores four computed variables for each domain user ID

• <b>Data Visualisations</b>: Folder containing all visualisations unravelled through the EDA (UD for unprocessed data; PD for processed data; all in png format)

## Motivation

(Given a dataset on website traffic from the Sydney Morning Herald...)

<b>1. Can you take a period of historical data and build a detector that flags unusual user behavior or Impossible Subscribers? 
  
2. Can you build a classifier that can suggest what type of user they are?

3. Can you detect bots that declare themselves versus bots that are being sneaky? 

4. Can you see potential new subscription product offerings emerge from the data?</b>

• For our analysis, I worked on the Exploratory Data Analysis to inform our product offerings, while other teammates worked on the modelling and qualitative research.

## Summary of Code

• Combined four datasets together into one very large dataset - which would be used for the analysis

• Created multiple data visualisations - including bar charts and histograms - to get basic insights into the data

## Summary of Results

• Through the EDA, we noticed that 'Coronavirus' was the most viewed primary article category. Through this, we advised the creation of a subscription plan so readers could get exclusive 'Coronavirus' content, including other perks, to increase the amount of subscribers.

• We also looked into ways to provide different subscription plans to readers depending on the sites they were referred from - which informed our alternative recommendation.
